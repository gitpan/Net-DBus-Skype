Revision history for Net-DBus-Skype

0.02    Now we use Moose.
        Now we have a script/module configuration
        We no longer use warn/exit, so no exit codes...
        We no longer debug to stdout.
        We no longer have a variable DEBUG but a ro accessor debug
           which is set it new
        We have totally restructured program to make sense
        Seperated Skype init code from DBus find code
        Renamed bus to dbus, call_skype, to raw_skype
        Provide two scripts
           skype-simple-dial - mandatory install
           skype-action-handler - optional by prompt (same name as Skype official)
